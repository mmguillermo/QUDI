### Comments:
### FOMEvaluation is the type of figure of merit evaluation:
### 0: by python module (needs PyModPath to the python file and PyModName, the name of the module)
### The module must contain a function named fnct, that takes the RedCRAB pulse(s) (as list of lists) and the time grid as
### parameters and returns the figure of merit
### 1: by saving the pulse in the PulsePath file, executing the command in Command and then reading the figure
### of merit from FOMPath - > the fom must be saved as a float in a text file called fom.txt (standard devaiation as std.txt)
### 2: by saving the pulse in the PulsePath file and then waiting for an update of the FOMPath file
### 3: by employing the 'MATLAB Engine API for Python'.
###
### ServerWaittime is the time the redcrab client will wait for a server answer (new pulse) until it calles a timeout and exits
### (in sec., min: 100, max : 18000)
###
### UserWaittime is the amount of time the redcrab client will wait for an update of the figure of merit file
### (in sec., min: 100, max : 86400)
###
### AbortCheck is the amount of seconds between consequtive checks if the user aborted the optimization by a stop file
### (in sec., min : 1, max : 30)
###
### ChannelTimeout is the number of seconds until timeout because of no connection
### (in sec. min. : 10, max : 30)
###
### ServerCheckInterval is the amount of seconds between consequtive checks for a pulse on the server 
### (in sec., min : 0.01, max : 30)
###
### UserCheckInterval is the amount of seconds between consequtive checks for a new figure of merit
### (in sec., min : 0.01, max : 30)
### 
### PulseFormat is the seperator between numbers in the pulse files
### possible are: 0 -> "  ", 1 -> " , ", 2 -> ",  "
###
### Pulse Accuracy is the number of decimal places of the pulse
### (min 2, max. ### 10)
###
### MatlabengineRestartInterval is the interval after which the matlab engine will be restarted (if FOMEvaluation == 3)
### (This is needed when using floating licenses, e.g. at ulm uni the license will be returned after 5 hours, so we restart every ~3h (10000 secs) to avoid program interruptions
### 
### Concerning the 'User Specific Paths': Avoid spaces and other unconventional characters in paths (and filenames)!!
