RedCRAB Client program
========================

Prerequisites:
-------------

+++ Python 3.5+ (may work with older versions of the 3.0 branch, but not with 2.7+ branch)
+++ Paramiko 2.1.2+ (may work with older versions, but is unsupported)
+++ numpy 1.12.0+ (may work with older versions, but is unsupported)
+++ matplotlib 2.2.2+ (may work with older versions, but is unsupported)
+++ scipy 1.0.1+ (may work with older versions, but is unsupported)
+++ Hint: The above points are best installed using pip3 (9.0.1+) 
+++ matlab.engine (for fomevaluation = 3, see /Config/Client_config/chopped.txt file and 
                   https://it.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/install-the-matlab-engine-for-python.html 
                   for more informations)
+++ Stable internet connection


Step by Step instructions:
-------------
1) Get a key.txt file for your identification as user on the RedCRAB server and put it in the 
   /Config/Client_config folder.

2) Configure your chopped.txt file located in the /Config/Client_config folder. For details on 
   the configurations see below for 'Client configuration'

3) Put a RedCRAB config file in the Config/RedCRAB_config folder. Its name has to be of the form:
   'Cfg_#jobid#.txt' where #jobid# is to be replaced with a job id (a number with at most 8 digits) 
   you need to give the job for identification

4) Start the RedCRAB.py script (if this does not work for some reason start the redcrab.py script in the 
   /bin folder)

Once Step 1) and Step 2) are done one can start future for jobs with step 3)


Feature Guide:
-------------

+++ Recovery - If you loose connection during a running optimization (or abort the job by a Keyboard Interrupt)
               a restart will start you off where the optimization left off (provided you fixed the connection problems).
               You can disable recovery at restart by deleting the /bin/tmp folder if it exists before starting an optimization

+++ Flexibiliy - Three different ways available to communicate with a client program for 
                 figure of merit evaluation (see 'Client configuration')

+++ Configurability - Setting timeouts for the program and formats with which the pulses are saved and 
                      their display accuracy (see 'Client configuration')

+++ Detailed event logging - If errors occur you will be notified about their cause and you can react accordingly.
                             Ane even more detailed log file will be created in your job folder (see 'Where is my data?')


Client Configuration:
-------------

The chopped.txt file in the /Config/Client_config folder provides customization options and contains some
required setting for the communication of the program with the RedCRAB Client. The file itself is commented, here
is a short list of someimportant parameters:

+++ FOMEvaluation - The most important parrameter. Sets type of figure of merit evaluation. Has three settings: 0, 1 and 2.
		    Set to 0: Figure of merit evaluation via a python module. The module must contain a function called
                              fnct(RedCRAB_pulses, time_grid) that takes two arguments. The first one is a list of 
                              numpy arrays that contains the pulses, the second one is a numpy array, that contains the 
                              time grid.
                              ----> Need to set PyModPath to the (full!) path to the python script
                              ----> Need to set PyModName to the name of the python script (without .py)

		    Set to 1: Figure of merit evaluation via file exchange and calling a bash command.
			      A file with the pulses and the time grid (first column is the time grid, the following ones
                              are the pulses) is stored in the file specified by PulsePath (the file does not need to exist
	                      at optimization start). The command specified in Command is executed and the Client waits for
                              an update of the file in the FOMPath.
                              ----> Need to set PulsePath to the (full!) path to where the current pulses + time grid should
                                    be saved.
                              ----> Need to set FOMPath to the (full!) path to where your module stores the current 
                                    evaluated figure of merit after evaluation.
                              ----> Need to set Command to the command that is to be executed to run your figure of merit 
                                    evaluation script.

		    Set to 2: Figure of merit evaluation via direct file exchange.
			      A file with the pulses and the time grid (first column is the time grid, the following ones
                              are the pulses) is stored in the file specified by PulsePath (the file does not need to exist
	                      at optimization start). The Client then waits for an update of the file in the FOMPath.
                              ----> Need to set PulsePath to the (full!) path to where the current pulses + time grid should
                                    be saved.
                              ----> Need to set FOMPath to the (full!) path to where your module stores the current 
                                    evaluated figure of merit after evaluation.

+++ PulseFormat - Sets the format with which the Client program stores the pulse files. It specifies the
                  seperator between different columns. Possible are: 0 -> "  ", 1 -> " , ", 2 -> ",  "

+++ PulseAccuracy - Sets the number of decimal places for the pulse stored in files.

+++ PyModPath - (full!) path to the python script for FOMEvaluation set to 0

+++ PyModName -  Name of the python script (without .py) for FOMEvaluation set to 0

+++ PulsePath  - (full!) path to where the current pulses + time grid should be saved for FOMEvaluation set to 1 or 2

+++ FOMPath  - (full!) path to where the user evaluated current figure of merit should be saved for 
               FOMEvaluation set to 1 or 2

+++ Command  - Command that is to be executed to run your figure of merit evaluation script for FOMEvaluation set to 1


Where is my data?/my config file?
-------------

+++ If you put a (proper) RedCRAB config file in the Config/RedCRAB_config the Client program will create a
    stats folder with your job id name in the /RedCRAB/userstats directory. It is strongly recommended to use a new job id
    for each new job that you start. If a job with the same name is found to have an existing folder in the
    /RedCRAB/userstats the job id of the current will be modified with a timestamp with the current date and time.

+++ Your RedCRAB config file will (at the earliest occasion) be stored in your stats folder as well

+++ Pulses that the RedCRAB server sent are stored in a subfolder called Pulses, which contains more 
    subfolders sorted by Superiterations. The Optimal pulses are stored in a subfolder called Opti_Pulses.

+++ The figures of merit are stored in two files. One named Res_#jobid#_FomData.txt, which is just a list of all the
    recieved figures of merit and another one named Res_#jobid#_FullData.txt, that contains additional information
    (e.g. about suberiterations and function evaluations). Both have your set job id #jobid# in their names.

+++ The logs for a job are also found (in a seperate subfolder) in the jobs stats folder.


Known issues:
-------------

Extremly rare and not reproducible bug, in which the Config program stops, because an OSError occurred while
putting the RedCRAB config file to the server. In this case just wait a little and start a new optimization 
run with your RedCRAB config file.
